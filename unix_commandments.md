And lo(look!) Unix\* spoke these words upon the reboot:

1. Thou shat use no other operating system than Unix
2. Thou shalt not make unto thee a false operating system. Thou shalt not program them for I am the Unix and a jealous O/S
3. Thou shalt not take the mark of trade of Unix in vain, or thou shalt be sued.
4. Remember thy password, and keep it secret
5. Honour thy parent shell, for if it should die thou shalt not live long (unless thou hast disassociated thy self)
6. Thou shalt not kill(l) -9 any processes, for surely they shalt becometh zombies or defunct
7. Thou shalt not commit hacking else thou shalt eat quiche.
8. Thou shalt not use other users data, for thou shalt be referred to the Data Protection Act, 1984 and sued (again)
9. Thou shalt not create Trojan Horses, worm, viruses, or other fowl beasts of false programming
10. Thou shalt not RM ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“rf thy neighbourÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s $HOME, nor covert his disk space allocation, nor his workstation account.

\*Let Unix be a trademark of AT&amp;T
